## Learning Clustering and Container Orchestration

> 📁 **All deployment files and important notes are available in the `deploy/` folder.**
> It includes Docker Swarm deployment files with explanations, as well as Kubernetes (k8s) manifests and documentation.

###  Docker Swarm and Kubernetes (k3s)

This project documents my learning journey into container orchestration using both **Docker Swarm** and **Kubernetes (k3s)**  and since learning by  applying  is my favourite method . i'll use  real project and try to deploy it with docker swarm and k8s .

To demonstrate concepts, I’ll be using the **[Example Voting App](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app)** –
a simple distributed microservices-based application that runs across multiple Docker containers.

---

### 🔧 Technologies Covered

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Docker Swarm
* Kubernetes (k3s lightweight distribution)

---

### 🧪 Hands-on Application

The **Example Voting App** is a great way to explore:

* Deploying and scaling services
* Managing containers in a cluster
* Networking between services
* Orchestrating deployments using Docker Swarm and Kubernetes
