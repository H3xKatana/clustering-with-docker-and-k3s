## Learning Clustering and Container Orchestration

### With Docker Swarm and Kubernetes (k3s)

This project documents my learning journey into container orchestration using both **Docker Swarm** and **Kubernetes (k3s)**.

To demonstrate concepts, I’ll be using the **[Example Voting App](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app)** –
a simple distributed microservices-based application that runs across multiple Docker containers.

---

### 🔧 Technologies Covered

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Docker Swarm
* Kubernetes (k3s lightweight distribution)

---

### 🧪 Hands-on Application

The **Example Voting App** is a great way to explore:

* Deploying and scaling services
* Managing containers in a cluster
* Networking between services
* Orchestrating deployments using Docker Swarm and Kubernetes
